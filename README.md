#### Plan the Data Flow
Map out how data flows between entities
Discuss as a group how the database will be structured and implemented.
#### Group Collaboration
Work as a group to analyze, design, and implement the database.
Each member is responsible for understanding all aspects of the project.
#### Submission
Each group must create a GitHub repository and make it public so that it is accessible to the reviewer.
Submit the final ERD and ecomerce.sql file to the repository.

### Group Collaboration
- Work as a team throughout the process.
- Each member must understand the entire project, not just the parts they worked on.
- Use GitHub to collaborate, track changes, and document progress.
- Conduct regular check-ins to review work, troubleshoot issues, and align on tasks.
