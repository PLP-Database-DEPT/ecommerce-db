### Peer Group Assignment: E-commerce Database Design

#### Objective
This challenge is designed to help learners understand and implement database design principles. Each group will develop an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and collaboratively implement a database project.
### Instructions

#### Create an  ERD
Clearly define all entities (tables) and their attributes.
Understand and document the relationships between tables.
Identify primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
You can use tools such as Lucidchart, draw.io, dbdiagram.io, or MySQL Workbench to create the ERD.
#### Plan the Data Flow
Map out how data flows between entities
Discuss as a group how the database will be structured and implemented.
#### Group Collaboration
Work as a group to analyze, design, and implement the database.
Each member is responsible for understanding all aspects of the project.
#### Submission
Each group must create a GitHub repository and make it public so that it is accessible to the reviewer.
Submit the final ERD and ecomerce.sql file to the repository.

### Group Collaboration
- Work as a team throughout the process.
- Each member must understand the entire project, not just the parts they worked on.
- Use GitHub to collaborate, track changes, and document progress.
- Conduct regular check-ins to review work, troubleshoot issues, and align on tasks.

### Tables to Be Created
Here are the key tables that you'll design and implement for the e-commerce database:
- product_image: Stores product image URLs or file references.
- color: Manages available color options.
- product_category: Classifies products into categories (e.g., clothing, electronics).
- product: Stores general product details (e.g., name, brand, base price).
- product_item: Represents individual purchasable items with specific variations.
- brand: Stores brand-related data.
- product_variation: Links a product to its variations (e.g., size, color).
- size_category: Groups sizes into categories (e.g., clothing sizes, shoe sizes).
- size_option: Lists specific sizes (e.g., S, M, L, 42).
- product_attribute: Stores custom attributes (e.g., material, weight).
- attribute_category: Categorizes attributes into groups (e.g., physical, technical).
- attribute_type: Defines types of attributes (e.g., text, number, boolean).
